## 📝 Project Overview  
**Slide Puzzle** is a fun and classic sliding tile game where you rearrange pieces to complete the original picture.  
I designed it with a **colorful** and **easy-to-use** interface, so it’s great for beginners, but also challenging enough for anyone who wants to test their skills with different difficulty levels or complete in the shortest time

The main goal of this project was to **level up my frontend skills** by putting into practice what I’ve learned in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It’s my **first real project**, built after 4 months of learning — and it marks an important step in my journey of becoming a better web developer.

## 🎮 Main Components

1. **Board Game**
- A large game board that is easy to see on any screen size.
- Difficulty levels ranging from **3x3** up to **10x10**.
- Smooth animations and lively interactions for a more engaging experience.
- A **preview button** next to the board to preview the completed image.

2. **Gallery**
- A collection of images to change the puzzle picture — simply click an image to apply it.
- The currently selected image is clearly highlighted with an animation.
- Responsive design: the gallery can shrink to fit smaller screen widths, and will automatically expand to full size when hovered.

3. **Game Options**
- Contains essential controls for the board game and gameplay, including:
     - **Start**: shuffle the tiles into a solvable arrangement and begin playing, or reshuffle at any time.
     - **Restart**: restart the game from the beginning, with a confirmation prompt if the game is in progress.
     - **Pause**: pause the game and timer; resume by clicking again or moving a tile.
       ( **Pause** and **Restart** only appear after the first tile movement (when the timer starts) ).
     - **Timer**: tracks the completion time, starting on the first tile move. Includes animations to indicate whether the timer is running or paused.
     - **Steps**: counts the number of tile moves made until the puzzle is completed.
     - **Levels**: hover to display a list of available difficulty levels to choose from.
     - **Show Tile Numbers**: toggle to display tile numbers for easier puzzle solving.
